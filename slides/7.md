# Parser Class
* This is where the bulk of our implementation's complexity exists
* Takes a command string like `ls -l >> files.txt` and parses it into blocks
* Instead of writing a regular expression for each command, we take a simpler approach
* Each "block" in the command string is added to a queue. After being parsed into a queue, the above command string would look like this:
    1. `ls`
    2. `-l`
    3. `>>`
    4. `files.txt`
