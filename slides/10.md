# IoC Container Class
* Implementation really isn't as complex as you would expect
* Each command is enlisted by storing the command name and the constructor of the class in a map
* Command resolution happens like this:
    1. Does the command name end in '.cpp' or '.c' ? Return a QuickCompile command
    2. Does the command name end in '.sh' ? Return a ShellScript command
    3. Does the map of internal commands contain the command name? Return the correct command
    4. If the command name does not satisfy any of the above conditions, return an External command
