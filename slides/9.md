# Command Class
* A template / parent class that forces a command to adhere to a standard API
* All commands implement the same constructor signature, where the constructor accepts a string vector of arguments as well as the original command string
* All commands implement an execute method that returns a string where that string is the output of executing the method
* Returning a string let's other parts of the application handle output, rather than the command objects
