# Shell Error Class
* We heavily use C++'s `try`, `catch`, and `throw` syntax to make error handling clear and easy to use
* Normally, there would be a class for each error type the command might encounter
* Software requirements for mysh only required one error, and the output is the same for all errors, thus only one error handling class
