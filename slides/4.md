# Inversion of Control

* The concept powering that "central component"
* We call this component our IoC container, and we register all available internal commands with the IoC container
* Our Parsers and Shell classes resolve commands from this IoC container
* Registering commands is really simple:

        class MyCommand : Command { /* Class Logic */ }
    
        int main(){
            // Register a command with the IoC
            IoC.commands.enlist("mycommand", MyCommand);
            
            // Resolving a command from the IoC
            IoC.commands.resolve("mycommand", /* constructor arguments */);
        }
