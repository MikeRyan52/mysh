# Regarding our Development Process
* Ended up using git as our version control system instead of Google Drive
* Git let us easily work on the same body of code without worrying about overwrites or merging
* Hosted our git repository on Github. Full source code and slides for our shell can be found at https://github.com/MikeRyanDesigns/mysh
* Github let us visually view changes in the source code as well as create issues that were assigned to team members throughout the lifecycle of the development process
