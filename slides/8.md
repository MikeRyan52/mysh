* Top of the queue is expected to be the name of the command
* Each subsequent element in the queue is expected to be an argument and is added to a string vector
* When the parser hits an output operator like `>>`, it halts adding arguments to the string vector and changes output mode accordingly
* After parsing is completed, the parser sends the command name and arguments to the IoC container to resolve the command as an object, then executes it
